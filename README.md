# SPA
Single Page Application in Javascript

This is a front end application that consumes data from an API to display product information.
The user will be able to categorize the product and also sort the products based on Price and Quality.

Please refer the SPA-UX for the intended design

A locally running webserver is not really needed.
It will also work if you simply double-click index.html.

You could run a node server or python server.

Node Server : https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
Python Server : python3 -m http.server (Python3)
                python -m SimpleHTTPServer (Lower Versions)
