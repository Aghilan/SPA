# SPA
Single Page Application in Javascript


A locally running webserver is needed, since the application uses AJAX.
It will not work if you simply double-click index.html.

You could run a node server or python server.

Node Server : https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
Python Server : python3 -m http.server (Python3)
                python -m SimpleHTTPServer (Lower Versions)
